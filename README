TestSimple - A simple unit testing framework for OCaml

This is a very simple, but easy to use unit testing framework based on 
Perl's very successful Test::* modules. It produces output using the 
TAP protocol, which is easily read by the Perl module Test::Harness. This 
means that OCaml tests can take advantage of many of the nice TAP based 
tools that Perl has to offer.

Installation
=============================================

Requirements:
- OCaml
- GNU make
- the findlib library manager (ocamlfind command)
- the ExtLib library

If you want to take advantage of Perl's testing 
utilities for processing TAP output, it is suggested 
that you have a reasonably modern Perl version 
(5.6.0 or above should do). 

From the source directory, do:

  make
  make install

If you want to run the test suite, do:

  make test 

NOTE: This requires the prove utility to be available 
on your system, this comes with the perl module 
Test::Harness and should already be available on most 
*nix-like systems.

If you want to remove the package do:

  make uninstall
